        Jane Eyre (/ɛər/ AIR; originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is a novel by the English writer
        Charlotte Brontë. It was published under her pen name "Currer Bell" on 19 October 1847 by Smith, Elder & Co. of
        London. The first American edition was published the following year by Harper & Brothers of New York.[2] Jane
        Eyre is a bildungsroman that follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood
        and her love for Mr Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.[3]

        The novel revolutionised prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its
        protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological
        intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the "first historian of the private consciousness" and the literary
        ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.[4]

        The book contains elements of social criticism with a strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and it is
        considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel
        approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism.[5][6] Jane Eyre, along with Jane Austen's
        Pride and Prejudice, is one of the most famous romance novels.The novel is a first-person narrative from the
        perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of
        George III (1760–1820).[a] It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is
        emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains
        friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where
        she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during
        which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with,
        and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of
        important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.

        A Passage to India is a 1924 novel by English author E. M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj
        and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of 20th century
        English literature by the Modern Library[2] and won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.[3]
        Time magazine included the novel in its "All Time 100 Novels" list.[4] The novel is based on Forster's
        experiences in India, deriving the title from Walt Whitman's 1870 poem "Passage to India" in Leaves of
        Grass.[5][6]

        The story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Mr. Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Miss
        Adela Quested. During a trip to the fictitious Marabar Caves (modeled on the Barabar Caves of Bihar),[7] Adela
        thinks she finds herself alone with Dr. Aziz in one of the caves (when in fact he is in an entirely different
        cave; whether the attacker is real or a reaction to the cave is ambiguous), and subsequently panics and flees;
        it is assumed that Dr. Aziz has attempted to assault her. Aziz's trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring to a
        boil the common racial tensions and prejudices between Indians and the British during the colonial era.

        Mrs. Dalloway is a novel by Virginia Woolf published on 14 May 1925.[1][2] It details a day in the life of
        Clarissa Dalloway, a fictional upper-class woman in post-First World War England. It is one of Woolf's
        best-known novels.

        The working title of Mrs. Dalloway was The Hours. The novel originated from two short stories, "Mrs. Dalloway in
        Bond Street" and the unfinished "The Prime Minister". In autumn 1922, Woolf began to think of the "Mrs.
        Dalloway" short story as the first chapter of her new novel,[2] and she completed the manuscript in late autumn
        1924.[3]

        The book describes Clarissa's preparations for a party she will host in the evening and the ensuing party. With
        an interior perspective, the story travels forwards and backwards in time to construct an image of Clarissa's
        life and the inter-war social structure. The novel addresses the nature of time in personal experience through
        multiple interwoven stories.

        In October 2005, Mrs. Dalloway was included on TIME Magazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels
        written since its first issue in 1923.
